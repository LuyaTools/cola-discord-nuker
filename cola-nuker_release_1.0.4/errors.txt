Error: Shard ID None is requesting privileged intents that have not been explicitly enabled in the developer portal. It is recommended to go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and explicitly enable the privileged intents within your application's page. If this is not possible, then consider disabling the privileged intents instead.
Solution: Enable ALL BOT INTENTS on the discord developer portal!

------------------


--- NEXTCORD ERRORS ---

Error: Nextcord is not compatible with discord!
Solution: Go to your cmd (WIN+R and type in 'cmd') and run 'pip uninstall discord'. Nextcord cant run with discord.py
